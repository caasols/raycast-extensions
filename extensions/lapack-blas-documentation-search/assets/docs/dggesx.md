DGGESX computes for a pair of N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrices
(A,B), the generalized eigenvalues, the real Schur form (S,T), and,
optionally, the left and/or right matrices of Schur vectors (VSL and
VSR).  This gives the generalized Schur factorization

(A,B) = ( (VSL) S (VSR)\*\*T, (VSL) T (VSR)\*\*T )

Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues so that a selected cluster
of eigenvalues appears in the leading diagonal blocks of the upper
quasi-triangular matrix S and the upper triangular matrix T; computes
a reciprocal condition number for the average of the selected
eigenvalues (RCONDE); and computes a reciprocal condition number for
the right and left deflating subspaces corresponding to the selected
eigenvalues (RCONDV). The leading columns of VSL and VSR then form
an orthonormal basis for the corresponding left and right eigenspaces
(deflating subspaces).

A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar w
or a ratio alpha/beta = w, such that  A - w\*B is singular.  It is
usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as there is a
reasonable interpretation for beta=0 or for both being zero.

A pair of matrices (S,T) is in generalized real Schur form if T is
upper triangular with non-negative diagonal and S is block upper
triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 blocks.  1-by-1 blocks correspond
to real generalized eigenvalues, while 2-by-2 blocks of S will be
by making the corresponding elements of T have the
form:
[  a  0  ]
[  0  b  ]

and the pair of corresponding 2-by-2 blocks in S and T will have a
complex conjugate pair of generalized eigenvalues.

## Parameters
JOBVSL : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  do not compute the left Schur vectors;
> = 'V':  compute the left Schur vectors.

JOBVSR : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  do not compute the right Schur vectors;
> = 'V':  compute the right Schur vectors.

SORT : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether or not to order the eigenvalues on the
> diagonal of the generalized Schur form.
> = 'N':  Eigenvalues are not ordered;
> = 'S':  Eigenvalues are ordered (see SELCTG).

SELCTG : a LOGICAL FUNCTION of three DOUBLE PRECISION arguments [in]
> SELCTG must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling subroutine.
> If SORT = 'N', SELCTG is not referenced.
> If SORT = 'S', SELCTG is used to select eigenvalues to sort
> to the top left of the Schur form.
> An eigenvalue (ALPHAR(j)+ALPHAI(j))/BETA(j) is selected if
> SELCTG(ALPHAR(j),ALPHAI(j),BETA(j)) is true; i.e. if either
> one of a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues is selected,
> then both complex eigenvalues are selected.
> Note that a selected complex eigenvalue may no longer satisfy
> SELCTG(ALPHAR(j),ALPHAI(j),BETA(j)) = .TRUE. after ordering,
> since ordering may change the value of complex eigenvalues
> (especially if the eigenvalue is ill-conditioned), in this
> case INFO is set to N+3.

SENSE : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
> = 'N':  None are computed;
> = 'E':  Computed for average of selected eigenvalues only;
> = 'V':  Computed for selected deflating subspaces only;
> = 'B':  Computed for both.
> If SENSE = 'E', 'V', or 'B', SORT must equal 'S'.

BETA : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N) [out]
> On exit, (ALPHAR(j) + ALPHAI(j)\*i)/BETA(j), j=1,...,N, will
> be the generalized eigenvalues.  ALPHAR(j) + ALPHAI(j)\*i
> and BETA(j),j=1,...,N  are the diagonals of the complex Schur
> form (S,T) that would result if the 2-by-2 diagonal blocks of
> the real Schur form of (A,B) were further reduced to
> triangular form using 2-by-2 complex unitary transformations.
> If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then the j-th eigenvalue is real; if
> positive, then the j-th and (j+1)-st eigenvalues are a
> complex conjugate pair, with ALPHAI(j+1) negative.
> 
> Note: the quotients ALPHAR(j)/BETA(j) and ALPHAI(j)/BETA(j)
> may easily over- or underflow, and BETA(j) may even be zero.
> Thus, the user should avoid naively computing the ratio.
> However, ALPHAR and ALPHAI will be always less than and
> usually comparable with norm(A) in magnitude, and BETA always
> less than and usually comparable with norm(B).

> LWORK >= max( 8\*N, 6\*N+16 ).
> Note that 2\*SDIM\*(N-SDIM) <= N\*N/2.
> Note also that an error is only returned if
