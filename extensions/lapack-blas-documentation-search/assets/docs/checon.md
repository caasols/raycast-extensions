        integer lda,

CHECON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex
Hermitian matrix A using the factorization A = U\*D\*U\*\*H or
A = L\*D\*L\*\*H computed by CHETRF.

An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM \* norm(inv(A))).

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
> as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
> = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U\*D\*U\*\*H;
> = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L\*D\*L\*\*H.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N) [in]
> The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
> obtain the factor U or L as computed by CHETRF.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

IPIV : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [in]
> Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
> as determined by CHETRF.

ANORM : REAL [in]
> The 1-norm of the original matrix A.

RCOND : REAL [out]
> The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
> computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM \* AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
> estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

WORK : COMPLEX array, dimension (2\*N) [out]

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
