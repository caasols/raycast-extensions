DLALS0 applies back the multiplying factors of either the left or the
right singular vector matrix of a diagonal matrix appended by a row
to the right hand side matrix B in solving the least squares problem
using the divide-and-conquer SVD approach.

For the left singular vector matrix, three types of orthogonal
matrices are involved:

(1L) Givens rotations: the number of such rotations is GIVPTR; the
pairs of columns/rows they were applied to are stored in GIVCOL;
and the C- and S-values of these rotations are stored in GIVNUM.

(2L) Permutation. The (NL+1)-st row of B is to be moved to the first
row, and for J=2:N, PERM(J)-th row of B is to be moved to the
J-th row.

(3L) The left singular vector matrix of the remaining matrix.

For the right singular vector matrix, four types of orthogonal
matrices are involved:

(1R) The right singular vector matrix of the remaining matrix.

(2R) If SQRE = 1, one extra Givens rotation to generate the right
null space.

(3R) The inverse transformation of (2L).

(4R) The inverse transformation of (1L).
