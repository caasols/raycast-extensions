SGEJSV computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real M-by-N
matrix [A], where M >= N. The SVD of [A] is written as

[A] = [U] \* [SIGMA] \* [V]^t,

where [SIGMA] is an N-by-N (M-by-N) matrix which is zero except for its N
diagonal elements, [U] is an M-by-N (or M-by-M) orthonormal matrix, and
[V] is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix. The diagonal elements of [SIGMA] are
the singular values of [A]. The columns of [U] and [V] are the left and
the right singular vectors of [A], respectively. The matrices [U] and [V]
are computed and stored in the arrays U and V, respectively. The diagonal
of [SIGMA] is computed and stored in the array SVA.
SGEJSV can sometimes compute tiny singular values and their singular vectors much
more accurately than other SVD routines, see below under Further Details.

## Parameters
JOBA : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies the level of accuracy:
> = 'C': This option works well (high relative accuracy) if A = B \* D,
> with well-conditioned B and arbitrary diagonal matrix D.
> The accuracy cannot be spoiled by COLUMN scaling. The
> accuracy of the computed output depends on the condition of
> B, and the procedure aims at the best theoretical accuracy.
> The relative error max_{i=1:N}|d sigma_i| / sigma_i is
> bounded by f(M,N)\*epsilon\* cond(B), independent of D.
> The input matrix is preprocessed with the QRF with column
> pivoting. This initial preprocessing and preconditioning by
> a rank revealing QR factorization is common for all values of
> JOBA. Additional actions are specified as follows:
> = 'E': Computation as with 'C' with an additional estimate of the
> condition number of B. It provides a realistic error bound.
> = 'F': If A = D1 \* C \* D2 with ill-conditioned diagonal scalings
> D1, D2, and well-conditioned matrix C, this option gives
> higher accuracy than the 'C' option. If the structure of the
> input matrix is not known, and relative accuracy is
> desirable, then this option is advisable. The input matrix A
> is preprocessed with QR factorization with FULL (row and
> column) pivoting.
> = 'G': Computation as with 'F' with an additional estimate of the
> condition number of B, where A=D\*B. If A has heavily weighted
> rows, then using this condition number gives too pessimistic
> error bound.
> = 'A': Small singular values are the noise and the matrix is treated
> as numerically rank deficient. The error in the computed
> singular values is bounded by f(m,n)\*epsilon\*||A||.
> The computed SVD A = U \* S \* V^t restores A up to
> f(m,n)\*epsilon\*||A||.
> This gives the procedure the licence to discard (set to zero)
> all singular values below N\*epsilon\*||A||.
> = 'R': Similar as in 'A'. Rank revealing property of the initial
> QR factorization is used do reveal (using triangular factor)
> a gap sigma_{r+1} < epsilon \* sigma_r in which case the
> numerical RANK is declared to be r. The SVD is computed with
> absolute error bounds, but more accurately than with 'A'.

JOBU : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether to compute the columns of U:
> = 'U': N columns of U are returned in the array U.
> = 'F': full set of M left sing. vectors is returned in the array U.
> = 'W': U may be used as workspace of length M\*N. See the description
> of U.
> = 'N': U is not computed.

JOBV : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether to compute the matrix V:
> = 'V': N columns of V are returned in the array V; Jacobi rotations
> are not explicitly accumulated.
> = 'J': N columns of V are returned in the array V, but they are
> computed as the product of Jacobi rotations. This option is
> allowed only if JOBU .NE. 'N', i.e. in computing the full SVD.
> = 'W': V may be used as workspace of length N\*N. See the description
> of V.
> = 'N': V is not computed.

JOBR : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies the RANGE for the singular values. Issues the licence to
> set to zero small positive singular values if they are outside
> specified range. If A .NE. 0 is scaled so that the largest singular
> value of c\*A is around SQRT(BIG), BIG=SLAMCH('O'), then JOBR issues
> the licence to kill columns of A whose norm in c\*A is less than
> SQRT(SFMIN) (for JOBR = 'R'), or less than SMALL=SFMIN/EPSLN,
> where SFMIN=SLAMCH('S'), EPSLN=SLAMCH('E').
> = 'N': Do not kill small columns of c\*A. This option assumes that
> BLAS and QR factorizations and triangular solvers are
> implemented to work in that range. If the condition of A
> is greater than BIG, use SGESVJ.
> = 'R': RESTRICTED range for sigma(c\*A) is [SQRT(SFMIN), SQRT(BIG)]
> (roughly, as described above). This option is recommended.
> ===========================
> For computing the singular values in the FULL range [SFMIN,BIG]
> use SGESVJ.

JOBT : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> If the matrix is square then the procedure may determine to use
> transposed A if A^t seems to be better with respect to convergence.
> If the matrix is not square, JOBT is ignored. This is subject to
> changes in the future.
> The decision is based on two values of entropy over the adjoint
> orbit of A^t \* A. See the descriptions of WORK(6) and WORK(7).
> = 'T': transpose if entropy test indicates possibly faster
> convergence of Jacobi process if A^t is taken as input. If A is
> replaced with A^t, then the row pivoting is included automatically.
> = 'N': do not speculate.
> This option can be used to compute only the singular values, or the
> full SVD (U, SIGMA and V). For only one set of singular vectors
> (U or V), the caller should provide both U and V, as one of the
> matrices is used as workspace if the matrix A is transposed.
> The implementer can easily remove this constraint and make the
> code more complicated. See the descriptions of U and V.

JOBP : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Issues the licence to introduce structured perturbations to drown
> denormalized numbers. This licence should be active if the
> denormals are poorly implemented, causing slow computation,
> especially in cases of fast convergence (!). For details see [1,2].
> For the sake of simplicity, this perturbations are included only
> when the full SVD or only the singular values are requested. The
> implementer/user can easily add the perturbation for the cases of
> computing one set of singular vectors.
> = 'P': introduce perturbation
> = 'N': do not perturb

> - For WORK(1) .NE. WORK(2): The singular values of A are
> (WORK(1)/WORK(2)) \* SVA(1:N). This factored form is used if
> sigma_max(A) overflows or if small singular values have been
> saved from underflow by scaling the input matrix A.
> - If JOBR='R' then some of the singular values may be returned
> as exact zeros obtained by  because they are
> below the numerical rank threshold or are denormalized numbers.

> the left singular vectors, including an ONB
> of the orthogonal complement of the Range(A).
> If JOBU = 'W'  .AND. (JOBV = 'V' .AND. JOBT = 'T' .AND. M = N),
> then U is used as workspace if the procedure
> replaces A with A^t. In that case, [V] is computed
> in U as left singular vectors of A^t and then
> copied back to the V array. This 'W' option is just
> a reminder to the caller that in this case U is
> reserved as workspace of length N\*N.
> If JOBU = 'N'  U is not referenced, unless JOBT='T'.

LDU : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array U,  LDU >= 1.
