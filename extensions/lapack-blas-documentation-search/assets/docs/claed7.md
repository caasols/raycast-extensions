CLAED7 computes the updated eigensystem of a diagonal
matrix after modification by a rank-one symmetric matrix. This
routine is used only for the eigenproblem which requires all
eigenvalues and optionally eigenvectors of a dense or banded
Hermitian matrix that has been reduced to tridiagonal form.

T = Q(in) ( D(in) + RHO \* Z\*Z\*\*H ) Q\*\*H(in) = Q(out) \* D(out) \* Q\*\*H(out)

where Z = Q\*\*Hu, u is a vector of length N with ones in the
CUTPNT and CUTPNT + 1 th elements and zeros elsewhere.

The eigenvectors of the original matrix are stored in Q, and the
eigenvalues are in D.  The algorithm consists of three stages:

The first stage consists of deflating the size of the problem
when there are multiple eigenvalues or if there is a zero in
the Z vector.  For each such occurrence the dimension of the
secular equation problem is reduced by one.  This stage is
performed by the routine SLAED2.

The second stage consists of calculating the updated
eigenvalues. This is done by finding the roots of the secular
equation via the routine SLAED4 (as called by SLAED3).
This routine also calculates the eigenvectors of the current
problem.

The final stage consists of computing the updated eigenvectors
directly using the updated eigenvalues.  The eigenvectors for
the current problem are multiplied with the eigenvectors from
the overall problem.

## Parameters
N : INTEGER [in]
> The dimension of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.  N >= 0.

CUTPNT : INTEGER [in]
> Contains the location of the last eigenvalue in the leading
> sub-matrix.  min(1,N) <= CUTPNT <= N.

QSIZ : INTEGER [in]
> The dimension of the unitary matrix used to reduce
> the full matrix to tridiagonal form.  QSIZ >= N.

TLVLS : INTEGER [in]

> Each number indicates the S value to be used in the
> corresponding Givens rotation.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit.
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
> > 0:  if INFO = 1, an eigenvalue did not converge
