DGEDMDQ computes the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for
a pair of data snapshot matrices, using a QR factorization
based compression of the data. For the input matrices
X and Y such that Y = A\*X with an unaccessible matrix
A, DGEDMDQ computes a certain number of Ritz pairs of A using
the standard Rayleigh-Ritz extraction from a subspace of
range(X) that is determined using the leading left singular
vectors of X. Optionally, DGEDMDQ returns the residuals
of the computed Ritz pairs, the information needed for
a refinement of the Ritz vectors, or the eigenvectors of
the Exact DMD.
For further details see the references listed
below. For more details of the implementation see [3].

> 'S' :: The data snapshots matrices X and Y are multiplied
> with a diagonal matrix D so that X\*D has unit
> nonzero columns (in the Euclidean 2-norm)
> 'C' :: The snapshots are scaled as with the 'S' option.
> If it is found that an i-th column of X is zero
> vector and the corresponding i-th column of Y is
> non-zero, then the i-th column of Y is set to
> zero and a warning flag is raised.

> the data snapshots. See the descriptions of F, V, Z.
> Q is from the initial QR factorization.
> 'N' :: The eigenvectors are not computed.

JOBR : JOBR (input) CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Determines whether to compute the residuals.
