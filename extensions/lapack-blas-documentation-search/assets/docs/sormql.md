SORMQL overwrites the general real M-by-N matrix C with

SIDE = 'L'     SIDE = 'R'
TRANS = 'N':      Q \* C          C \* Q
TRANS = 'T':      Q\*\*T \* C       C \* Q\*\*T

where Q is a real orthogonal matrix defined as the product of k
elementary reflectors

Q = H(k) . . . H(2) H(1)

as returned by SGEQLF. Q is of order M if SIDE = 'L' and of order N
if SIDE = 'R'.

## Parameters
SIDE : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'L': apply Q or Q\*\*T from the Left;
> = 'R': apply Q or Q\*\*T from the Right.

TRANS : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  No transpose, apply Q;
> = 'T':  Transpose, apply Q\*\*T.

M : INTEGER [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix C. M >= 0.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix C. N >= 0.

K : INTEGER [in]
> The number of elementary reflectors whose product defines
> the matrix Q.
> If SIDE = 'L', M >= K >= 0;
> if SIDE = 'R', N >= K >= 0.

A : REAL array, dimension (LDA,K) [in]
> The i-th column must contain the vector which defines the
> elementary reflector H(i), for i = 1,2,...,k, as returned by
> SGEQLF in the last k columns of its array argument A.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.
> If SIDE = 'L', LDA >= max(1,M);
> if SIDE = 'R', LDA >= max(1,N).

TAU : REAL array, dimension (K) [in]
> TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
> reflector H(i), as returned by SGEQLF.

C : REAL array, dimension (LDC,N) [in,out]
> On entry, the M-by-N matrix C.
> On exit, C is overwritten by Q\*C or Q\*\*T\*C or C\*Q\*\*T or C\*Q.

LDC : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array C. LDC >= max(1,M).

WORK : REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

LWORK : INTEGER [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.
> If SIDE = 'L', LWORK >= max(1,N);
> if SIDE = 'R', LWORK >= max(1,M).
> For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.
> 
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
