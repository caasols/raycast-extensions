SGBTF2 computes an LU factorization of a real m-by-n band matrix A
using partial pivoting with row interchanges.

This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

## Parameters
M : INTEGER [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

KL : INTEGER [in]
> The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.

KU : INTEGER [in]
> The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.

AB : REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N) [in,out]
> On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows KL+1 to
> 2\*KL+KU+1; rows 1 to KL of the array need not be set.
> The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
> array AB as follows:
> AB(kl+ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(m,j+kl)
> 
> On exit, details of the factorization: U is stored as an
> upper triangular band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in
> rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and the multipliers used during the
> factorization are stored in rows KL+KU+2 to 2\*KL+KU+1.
> See below for further details.

LDAB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2\*KL+KU+1.

IPIV : INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N)) [out]
> The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= min(M,N), row i of the
> matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0: if INFO = +i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
> has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
> singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
> to solve a system of equations.
