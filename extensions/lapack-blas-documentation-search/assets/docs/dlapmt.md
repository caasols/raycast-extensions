```fortran
subroutine dlapmt (
        logical forwrd,
        integer m,
        integer n,
        double precision, dimension( ldx, * ) x,
        integer ldx,
        integer, dimension( * ) k
)
```

DLAPMT rearranges the columns of the M by N matrix X as specified
by the permutation K(1),K(2),...,K(N) of the integers 1,...,N.
If FORWRD = .TRUE.,  forward permutation:

X(\*,K(J)) is moved X(\*,J) for J = 1,2,...,N.

If FORWRD = .FALSE., backward permutation:

X(\*,J) is moved to X(\*,K(J)) for J = 1,2,...,N.

## Parameters
FORWRD : LOGICAL [in]
> = .TRUE., forward permutation
> = .FALSE., backward permutation

M : INTEGER [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix X. M >= 0.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix X. N >= 0.

X : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,N) [in,out]
> On entry, the M by N matrix X.
> On exit, X contains the permuted matrix X.

LDX : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array X, LDX >= MAX(1,M).

K : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [in,out]
> On entry, K contains the permutation vector. K is used as
> internal workspace, but reset to its original value on
> output.
