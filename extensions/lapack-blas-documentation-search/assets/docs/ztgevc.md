ZTGEVC computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
a pair of complex matrices (S,P), where S and P are upper triangular.
Matrix pairs of this type are produced by the generalized Schur
factorization of a complex matrix pair (A,B):

A = Q\*S\*Z\*\*H,  B = Q\*P\*Z\*\*H

as computed by ZGGHRD + ZHGEQZ.

The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of (S,P)
corresponding to an eigenvalue w are defined by:

S\*x = w\*P\*x,  (y\*\*H)\*S = w\*(y\*\*H)\*P,

where y\*\*H denotes the conjugate transpose of y.
The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are computed
directly from the diagonal elements of S and P.

This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
eigenvectors of (S,P), or the products Z\*X and/or Q\*Y,
where Z and Q are input matrices.
If Q and Z are the unitary factors from the generalized Schur
factorization of a matrix pair (A,B), then Z\*X and Q\*Y
are the matrices of right and left eigenvectors of (A,B).
