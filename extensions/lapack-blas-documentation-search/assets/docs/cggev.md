CGGEV computes for a pair of N-by-N complex nonsymmetric matrices
(A,B), the generalized eigenvalues, and optionally, the left and/or
right generalized eigenvectors.

A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar
lambda or a ratio alpha/beta = lambda, such that A - lambda\*B is
singular. It is usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as
there is a reasonable interpretation for beta=0, and even for both
being zero.

The right generalized eigenvector v(j) corresponding to the
generalized eigenvalue lambda(j) of (A,B) satisfies

A \* v(j) = lambda(j) \* B \* v(j).

The left generalized eigenvector u(j) corresponding to the
generalized eigenvalues lambda(j) of (A,B) satisfies

u(j)\*\*H \* A = lambda(j) \* u(j)\*\*H \* B

where u(j)\*\*H is the conjugate-transpose of u(j).

## Parameters
JOBVL : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  do not compute the left generalized eigenvectors;
> = 'V':  compute the left generalized eigenvectors.

JOBVR : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  do not compute the right generalized eigenvectors;
> = 'V':  compute the right generalized eigenvectors.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrices A, B, VL, and VR.  N >= 0.

A : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA, N) [in,out]
> On entry, the matrix A in the pair (A,B).
> On exit, A has been overwritten.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

B : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB, N) [in,out]
> On entry, the matrix B in the pair (A,B).
> On exit, B has been overwritten.

LDB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

ALPHA : COMPLEX array, dimension (N) [out]

BETA : COMPLEX array, dimension (N) [out]
> On exit, ALPHA(j)/BETA(j), j=1,...,N, will be the
> generalized eigenvalues.
> 
> Note: the quotients ALPHA(j)/BETA(j) may easily over- or
> underflow, and BETA(j) may even be zero.  Thus, the user
> should avoid naively computing the ratio alpha/beta.
> However, ALPHA will be always less than and usually
> comparable with norm(A) in magnitude, and BETA always less
> than and usually comparable with norm(B).

VL : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVL,N) [out]
> If JOBVL = 'V', the left generalized eigenvectors u(j) are
> stored one after another in the columns of VL, in the same
> order as their eigenvalues.
> Each eigenvector is scaled so the largest component has
> abs(real part) + abs(imag. part) = 1.
> Not referenced if JOBVL = 'N'.

LDVL : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the matrix VL. LDVL >= 1, and
> if JOBVL = 'V', LDVL >= N.

VR : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVR,N) [out]
> If JOBVR = 'V', the right generalized eigenvectors v(j) are
> stored one after another in the columns of VR, in the same
> order as their eigenvalues.
> Each eigenvector is scaled so the largest component has
> abs(real part) + abs(imag. part) = 1.
> Not referenced if JOBVR = 'N'.

LDVR : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the matrix VR. LDVR >= 1, and
> if JOBVR = 'V', LDVR >= N.

WORK : COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

LWORK : INTEGER [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,2\*N).
> For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
> 
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

RWORK : REAL array, dimension (8\*N) [out]

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
> =1,...,N:
> The QZ iteration failed.  No eigenvectors have been
> calculated, but ALPHA(j) and BETA(j) should be
> correct for j=INFO+1,...,N.
> > N:  =N+1: other then QZ iteration failed in CHGEQZ,
> =N+2: error return from CTGEVC.
