CUNHR_COL takes an M-by-N complex matrix Q_in with orthonormal columns
as input, stored in A, and performs Householder Reconstruction (HR),
i.e. reconstructs Householder vectors V(i) implicitly representing
another M-by-N matrix Q_out, with the property that Q_in = Q_out\*S,
where S is an N-by-N diagonal matrix with diagonal entries
equal to +1 or -1. The Householder vectors (columns V(i) of V) are
stored in A on output, and the diagonal entries of S are stored in D.
Block reflectors are also returned in T
(same output format as CGEQRT).

## Parameters
M : INTEGER [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A. M >= 0.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix A. M >= N >= 0.

NB : INTEGER [in]
> The column block size to be used in the reconstruction
> of Householder column vector blocks in the array A and
> corresponding block reflectors in the array T. NB >= 1.
> (Note that if NB > N, then N is used instead of NB
> as the column block size.)

A : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N) [in,out]
> 
> On entry:
> 
> The array A contains an M-by-N orthonormal matrix Q_in,
> i.e the columns of A are orthogonal unit vectors.
> 
> On exit:
> 
> The elements below the diagonal of A represent the unit
> lower-trapezoidal matrix V of Householder column vectors
> V(i). The unit diagonal entries of V are not stored
> (same format as the output below the diagonal in A from
> CGEQRT). The matrix T and the matrix V stored on output
> in A implicitly define Q_out.
> 
> The elements above the diagonal contain the factor U
> of the  LU-decomposition:
> Q_in - ( S ) = V \* U
> ( 0 )
> where 0 is a (M-N)-by-(M-N) zero matrix.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).

T : COMPLEX array, [out]
> dimension (LDT, N)
> 
> Let NOCB = Number_of_output_col_blocks
> = CEIL(N/NB)
> 
> On exit, T(1:NB, 1:N) contains NOCB upper-triangular
> block reflectors used to define Q_out stored in compact
> form as a sequence of upper-triangular NB-by-NB column
> blocks (same format as the output T in CGEQRT).
> The matrix T and the matrix V stored on output in A
> implicitly define Q_out. NOTE: The lower triangles
> below the upper-triangular blocks will be filled with
> zeros. See Further Details.

LDT : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array T.
> LDT >= max(1,min(NB,N)).

D : COMPLEX array, dimension min(M,N). [out]
> The elements can be only plus or minus one.
> 
> D(i) is constructed as D(i) = -SIGN(Q_in_i(i,i)), where
> 1 <= i <= min(M,N), and Q_in_i is Q_in after performing
> i-1 steps of “modified” Gaussian elimination.
> See Further Details.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
