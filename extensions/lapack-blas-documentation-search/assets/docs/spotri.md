```fortran
subroutine spotri (
        character uplo,
        integer n,
        real, dimension( lda, * ) a,
        integer lda,
        integer info
)
```

SPOTRI computes the inverse of a real symmetric positive definite
matrix A using the Cholesky factorization A = U\*\*T\*U or A = L\*L\*\*T
computed by SPOTRF.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
> = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : REAL array, dimension (LDA,N) [in,out]
> On entry, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
> factorization A = U\*\*T\*U or A = L\*L\*\*T, as computed by
> SPOTRF.
> On exit, the upper or lower triangle of the (symmetric)
> inverse of A, overwriting the input factor U or L.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0:  if INFO = i, the (i,i) element of the factor U or L is
> zero, and the inverse could not be computed.
