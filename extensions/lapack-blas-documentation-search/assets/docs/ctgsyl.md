CTGSYL solves the generalized Sylvester equation:

A \* R - L \* B = scale \* C            (1)
D \* R - L \* E = scale \* F

where R and L are unknown m-by-n matrices, (A, D), (B, E) and
(C, F) are given matrix pairs of size m-by-m, n-by-n and m-by-n,
respectively, with complex entries. A, B, D and E are upper
triangular (i.e., (A,D) and (B,E) in generalized Schur form).

The solution (R, L) overwrites (C, F). 0 <= SCALE <= 1
is an output scaling factor chosen to avoid overflow.

In matrix notation (1) is equivalent to solve Zx = scale\*b, where Z
is defined as

Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B\*\*H, Im) ]        (2)
[ kron(In, D)  -kron(E\*\*H, Im) ],

Here Ix is the identity matrix of size x and X\*\*H is the conjugate
transpose of X. Kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the
matrices X and Y.

If TRANS = 'C', y in the conjugate transposed system Z\*\*H \*y = scale\*b
is solved for, which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

A\*\*H \* R + D\*\*H \* L = scale \* C           (3)
R \* B\*\*H + L \* E\*\*H = scale \* -F

This case (TRANS = 'C') is used to compute an one-norm-based estimate
of Dif[(A,D), (B,E)], the separation between the matrix pairs (A,D)
and (B,E), using CLACON.

If IJOB >= 1, CTGSYL computes a Frobenius norm-based estimate of
Dif[(A,D),(B,E)]. That is, the reciprocal of a lower bound on the
reciprocal of the smallest singular value of Z.

This is a level-3 BLAS algorithm.
