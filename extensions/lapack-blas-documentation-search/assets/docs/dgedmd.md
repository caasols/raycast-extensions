DGEDMD computes the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for
a pair of data snapshot matrices. For the input matrices
X and Y such that Y = A\*X with an unaccessible matrix
A, DGEDMD computes a certain number of Ritz pairs of A using
the standard Rayleigh-Ritz extraction from a subspace of
range(X) that is determined using the leading left singular
vectors of X. Optionally, DGEDMD returns the residuals
of the computed Ritz pairs, the information needed for
a refinement of the Ritz vectors, or the eigenvectors of
the Exact DMD.
For further details see the references listed
below. For more details of the implementation see [3].

## Parameters
JOBS : JOBS (input) is CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Determines whether the initial data snapshots are scaled
> by a diagonal matrix.
> 'S' :: The data snapshots matrices X and Y are multiplied
> with a diagonal matrix D so that X\*D has unit
> nonzero columns (in the Euclidean 2-norm)
> 'C' :: The snapshots are scaled as with the 'S' option.
> If it is found that an i-th column of X is zero
> vector and the corresponding i-th column of Y is
> non-zero, then the i-th column of Y is set to
> zero and a warning flag is raised.
> 'Y' :: The data snapshots matrices X and Y are multiplied
> by a diagonal matrix D so that Y\*D has unit
> nonzero columns (in the Euclidean 2-norm)
> 'N' :: No data scaling.

JOBZ : JOBZ (input) CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Determines whether the eigenvectors (Koopman modes) will
> be computed.
> 'V' :: The eigenvectors (Koopman modes) will be computed
> and returned in the matrix Z.
> See the description of Z.
> 'F' :: The eigenvectors (Koopman modes) will be returned
> in factored form as the product X(:,1:K)\*W, where X
> contains a POD basis (leading left singular vectors
> of the data matrix X) and W contains the eigenvectors
> of the corresponding Rayleigh quotient.
> See the descriptions of K, X, W, Z.
> 'N' :: The eigenvectors are not computed.

JOBR : JOBR (input) CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Determines whether to compute the residuals.
> 'R' :: The residuals for the computed eigenpairs will be
> computed and stored in the array RES.
> See the description of RES.
> For this option to be legal, JOBZ must be 'V'.
> 'N' :: The residuals are not computed.

JOBF : JOBF (input) CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether to store information needed for post-
> processing (e.g. computing refined Ritz vectors)
> 'R' :: The matrix needed for the refinement of the Ritz
> vectors is computed and stored in the array B.
> See the description of B.
> 'E' :: The unscaled eigenvectors of the Exact DMD are
> computed and returned in the array B. See the
> description of B.
> 'N' :: No eigenvector refinement data is computed.

> Allows for a selection of the SVD algorithm from the
> LAPACK library.
> 1 :: DGESVD (the QR SVD algorithm)
> 2 :: DGESDD (the Divide and Conquer algorithm; if enough
> workspace available, this is the fastest option)
> 3 :: DGESVDQ (the preconditioned QR SVD  ; this and 4
> are the most accurate options)
> 4 :: DGEJSV (the preconditioned Jacobi SVD; this and 3
> are the most accurate options)
> For the four methods above, a significant difference in
> the accuracy of small singular values is possible if
> the snapshots vary in norm so that X is severely
> ill-conditioned. If small (smaller than EPS\*||X||)
> singular values are of interest and JOBS=='N',  then
> the options (3, 4) give the most accurate results, where
> the option 4 is slightly better and with stronger
> theoretical background.
> If JOBS=='S', i.e. the columns of X will be normalized,
> then all methods give nearly equally accurate results.
