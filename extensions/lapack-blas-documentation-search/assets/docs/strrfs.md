STRRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular
coefficient matrix.

The solution matrix X must be computed by STRTRS or some other
means before entering this routine.  STRRFS does not do iterative
refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
> = 'L':  A is lower triangular.

TRANS : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies the form of the system of equations:
> = 'N':  A \* X = B  (No transpose)
> = 'T':  A\*\*T \* X = B  (Transpose)
> = 'C':  A\*\*H \* X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

DIAG : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
> = 'U':  A is unit triangular.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

NRHS : INTEGER [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
> of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.

A : REAL array, dimension (LDA,N) [in]
> The triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
> upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper
> triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of
> A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
> triangular part of the array A contains the lower triangular
> matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
> referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are
> also not referenced and are assumed to be 1.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

B : REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS) [in]
> The right hand side matrix B.

LDB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

X : REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS) [in]
> The solution matrix X.

LDX : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).

FERR : REAL array, dimension (NRHS) [out]
> The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
> X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
> If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
> is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
> element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
> largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
> the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
> overestimate of the true error.

BERR : REAL array, dimension (NRHS) [out]
> The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
> vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
> any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

WORK : REAL array, dimension (3\*N) [out]

IWORK : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [out]

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
