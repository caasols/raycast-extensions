subroutine zla_heamv (
        integer uplo,
        integer n,
        double precision alpha,
        complex*16, dimension( lda, * ) a,
        integer lda,
        complex*16, dimension( * ) x,

ZLA_SYAMV  performs the matrix-vector operation

y := alpha\*abs(A)\*abs(x) + beta\*abs(y),

where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are vectors and A is an
n by n symmetric matrix.

This function is primarily used in calculating error bounds.
To protect against underflow during evaluation, components in
the resulting vector are perturbed away from zero by (N+1)
times the underflow threshold.  To prevent unnecessarily large
errors for block-structure embedded in general matrices,
zero components are not perturbed.  A zero
entry is considered  if all multiplications involved
in computing that entry have at least one zero multiplicand.

## Parameters
UPLO : INTEGER [in]
> On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
> triangular part of the array A is to be referenced as
> follows:
> 
> UPLO = BLAS_UPPER   Only the upper triangular part of A
> is to be referenced.
> 
> UPLO = BLAS_LOWER   Only the lower triangular part of A
> is to be referenced.
> 
> Unchanged on exit.

N : INTEGER [in]
> On entry, N specifies the number of columns of the matrix A.
> N must be at least zero.
> Unchanged on exit.

ALPHA : DOUBLE PRECISION . [in]
> On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.
> Unchanged on exit.

A : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension ( LDA, n ). [in]
> Before entry, the leading m by n part of the array A must
> contain the matrix of coefficients.
> Unchanged on exit.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
> in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
> max( 1, n ).
> Unchanged on exit.

X : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension at least [in]
> ( 1 + ( n - 1 )\*abs( INCX ) )
> Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the
> vector x.
> Unchanged on exit.

INCX : INTEGER [in]
> On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
> X. INCX must not be zero.
> Unchanged on exit.

BETA : DOUBLE PRECISION . [in]
> On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta. When BETA is
> supplied as zero then Y need not be set on input.
> Unchanged on exit.

Y : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension [in,out]
> ( 1 + ( n - 1 )\*abs( INCY ) )
> Before entry with BETA non-zero, the incremented array Y
> must contain the vector y. On exit, Y is overwritten by the
> updated vector y.

INCY : INTEGER [in]
> On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of
> Y. INCY must not be zero.
> Unchanged on exit.
