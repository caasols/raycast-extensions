ZHBGVD computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite banded eigenproblem, of
the form A\*x=(lambda)\*B\*x. Here A and B are assumed to be Hermitian
and banded, and B is also positive definite.  If eigenvectors are
desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.

## Parameters
JOBZ : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
> = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'U':  Upper triangles of A and B are stored;
> = 'L':  Lower triangles of A and B are stored.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.

KA : INTEGER [in]
> The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
> or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'. KA >= 0.

KB : INTEGER [in]
> The number of superdiagonals of the matrix B if UPLO = 'U',
> or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'. KB >= 0.

AB : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension (LDAB, N) [in,out]
> On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian band
> matrix A, stored in the first ka+1 rows of the array.  The
> j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
> as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', AB(ka+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ka)<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+ka).
> 
> On exit, the contents of AB are destroyed.

LDAB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KA+1.

BB : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension (LDBB, N) [in,out]
> On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian band
> matrix B, stored in the first kb+1 rows of the array.  The
> j-th column of B is stored in the j-th column of the array BB
> as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', BB(kb+1+i-j,j) = B(i,j) for max(1,j-kb)<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', BB(1+i-j,j)    = B(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kb).
> 
> On exit, the factor S from the split Cholesky factorization
> B = S\*\*H\*S, as returned by ZPBSTF.

LDBB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array BB.  LDBB >= KB+1.

W : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N) [out]
> If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.

Z : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension (LDZ, N) [out]
> If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the matrix Z of
> eigenvectors, with the i-th column of Z holding the
> eigenvector associated with W(i). The eigenvectors are
> normalized so that Z\*\*H\*B\*Z = I.
> If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.

LDZ : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
> JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= N.

WORK : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO=0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

LWORK : INTEGER [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.
> If N <= 1,               LWORK >= 1.
> If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LWORK >= N.
> If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LWORK >= 2\*N\*\*2.
> 
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK and
> IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
> the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
> related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.

RWORK : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LRWORK)) [out]

> If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LRWORK >= N.
> If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LRWORK >= 1 + 5\*N + 2\*N\*\*2.
> 
> If LRWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the

IWORK : INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK)) [out]

LIWORK : INTEGER [in]
> The dimension of array IWORK.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is:
> <= N:  the algorithm failed to converge:
> i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
> tridiagonal form did not converge to zero;
> > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= N, then ZPBSTF
> returned INFO = i: B is not positive definite.
