CGSVJ1 is called from CGESVJ as a pre-processor and that is its main
purpose. It applies Jacobi rotations in the same way as CGESVJ does, but
it targets only particular pivots and it does not check convergence
(stopping criterion). Few tuning parameters (marked by [TP]) are
available for the implementer.

Further Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CGSVJ1 applies few sweeps of Jacobi rotations in the column space of
the input M-by-N matrix A. The pivot pairs are taken from the (1,2)
off-diagonal block in the corresponding N-by-N Gram matrix A^T \* A. The
block-entries (tiles) of the (1,2) off-diagonal block are marked by the
[x]'s in the following scheme:

| \*  \*  \* [x] [x] [x]|
| \*  \*  \* [x] [x] [x]|    Row-cycling in the nblr-by-nblc [x] blocks.
| \*  \*  \* [x] [x] [x]|    Row-cyclic pivoting inside each [x] block.
|[x] [x] [x] \*  \*  \* |
|[x] [x] [x] \*  \*  \* |
|[x] [x] [x] \*  \*  \* |

In terms of the columns of A, the first N1 columns are rotated 'against'
the remaining N-N1 columns, trying to increase the angle between the
corresponding subspaces. The off-diagonal block is N1-by(N-N1) and it is
tiled using quadratic tiles of side KBL. Here, KBL is a tuning parameter.
The number of sweeps is given in NSWEEP and the orthogonality threshold
is given in TOL.

## Parameters
JOBV : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the output from this procedure is used
> to compute the matrix V:
> = 'V': the product of the Jacobi rotations is accumulated
> by postmultiplying the N-by-N array V.
> (See the description of V.)
> = 'A': the product of the Jacobi rotations is accumulated
> by postmultiplying the MV-by-N array V.
> (See the descriptions of MV and V.)
> = 'N': the Jacobi rotations are not accumulated.

M : INTEGER [in]
> The number of rows of the input matrix A.  M >= 0.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The number of columns of the input matrix A.
> M >= N >= 0.

N1 : INTEGER [in]
> N1 specifies the 2 x 2 block partition, the first N1 columns are
> rotated 'against' the remaining N-N1 columns of A.

A : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N) [in,out]
> On entry, M-by-N matrix A, such that A\*diag(D) represents

> On entry, SVA contains the Euclidean norms of the columns of

> the matrix onexit\*diag(D_onexit).

MV : INTEGER [in]
> If JOBV = 'A', then MV rows of V are post-multiplied by a

LWORK : INTEGER [in]
