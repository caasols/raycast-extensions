```fortran
subroutine cheswapr (
        character uplo,
        integer n,

CHESWAPR applies an elementary permutation on the rows and the columns of
a hermitian matrix.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
> as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
> = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U\*D\*U\*\*T;
> = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L\*D\*L\*\*T.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N) [in,out]
> On entry, the NB diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
> used to obtain the factor U or L as computed by CSYTRF.
> 
> On exit, if INFO = 0, the (symmetric) inverse of the original
> matrix.  If UPLO = 'U', the upper triangular part of the
> inverse is formed and the part of A below the diagonal is not
> referenced; if UPLO = 'L' the lower triangular part of the
> inverse is formed and the part of A above the diagonal is
> not referenced.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

I1 : INTEGER [in]
> Index of the first row to swap

I2 : INTEGER [in]
> Index of the second row to swap
