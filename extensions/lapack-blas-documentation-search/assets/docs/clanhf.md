CLANHF  returns the value of the one norm,  or the Frobenius norm, or
the  infinity norm,  or the  element of  largest absolute value  of a
complex Hermitian matrix A in RFP format.

## Parameters
NORM : CHARACTER [in]
> Specifies the value to be returned in CLANHF as described
> above.

TRANSR : CHARACTER [in]
> Specifies whether the RFP format of A is normal or
> conjugate-transposed format.
> = 'N':  RFP format is Normal
> = 'C':  RFP format is Conjugate-transposed

UPLO : CHARACTER [in]
> On entry, UPLO specifies whether the RFP matrix A came from
> an upper or lower triangular matrix as follows:
> 
> UPLO = 'U' or 'u' RFP A came from an upper triangular
> matrix
> 
> UPLO = 'L' or 'l' RFP A came from a  lower triangular
> matrix

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  When N = 0, CLANHF is
> set to zero.

A : COMPLEX array, dimension ( N\*(N+1)/2 ); [in]
> On entry, the matrix A in RFP Format.
> RFP Format is described by TRANSR, UPLO and N as follows:
> If TRANSR='N' then RFP A is (0:N,0:K-1) when N is even;
> K=N/2. RFP A is (0:N-1,0:K) when N is odd; K=N/2. If
> TRANSR = 'C' then RFP is the Conjugate-transpose of RFP A
> as defined when TRANSR = 'N'. The contents of RFP A are
> defined by UPLO as follows: If UPLO = 'U' the RFP A
> contains the ( N\*(N+1)/2 ) elements of upper packed A
> either in normal or conjugate-transpose Format. If
> UPLO = 'L' the RFP A contains the ( N\*(N+1) /2 ) elements
> of lower packed A either in normal or conjugate-transpose
> Format. The LDA of RFP A is (N+1)/2 when TRANSR = 'C'. When
> TRANSR is 'N' the LDA is N+1 when N is even and is N when
> is odd. See the Note below for more details.
> Unchanged on exit.

WORK : REAL array, dimension (LWORK), [out]
> where LWORK >= N when NORM = 'I' or '1' or 'O'; otherwise,
> WORK is not referenced.
