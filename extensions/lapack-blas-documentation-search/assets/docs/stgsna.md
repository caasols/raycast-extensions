STGSNA estimates reciprocal condition numbers for specified
eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors of a matrix pair (A, B) in
generalized real Schur canonical form (or of any matrix pair
(Q\*A\*Z\*\*T, Q\*B\*Z\*\*T) with orthogonal matrices Q and Z, where
Z\*\*T denotes the transpose of Z.

(A, B) must be in generalized real Schur form (as returned by SGGES),
i.e. A is block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal
blocks. B is upper triangular.

## Parameters
JOB : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether condition numbers are required for
> eigenvalues (S) or eigenvectors (DIF):
> = 'E': for eigenvalues only (S);
> = 'V': for eigenvectors only (DIF);
> = 'B': for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors (S and DIF).

HOWMNY : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'A': compute condition numbers for all eigenpairs;
> = 'S': compute condition numbers for selected eigenpairs
> specified by the array SELECT.

SELECT : LOGICAL array, dimension (N) [in]
> If HOWMNY = 'S', SELECT specifies the eigenpairs for which
> condition numbers are required. To select condition numbers
> for the eigenpair corresponding to a real eigenvalue w(j),
> SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE.. To select condition numbers
> corresponding to a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues w(j)
> and w(j+1), either SELECT(j) or SELECT(j+1) or both, must be
> set to .TRUE..
> If HOWMNY = 'A', SELECT is not referenced.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the square matrix pair (A, B). N >= 0.

A : REAL array, dimension (LDA,N) [in]
> The upper quasi-triangular matrix A in the pair (A,B).

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).

B : REAL array, dimension (LDB,N) [in]
> The upper triangular matrix B in the pair (A,B).

LDB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).

VL : REAL array, dimension (LDVL,M) [in]
> If JOB = 'E' or 'B', VL must contain left eigenvectors of
> (A, B), corresponding to the eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY
> and SELECT. The eigenvectors must be stored in consecutive
> columns of VL, as returned by STGEVC.
> If JOB = 'V', VL is not referenced.

LDVL : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array VL. LDVL >= 1.
> If JOB = 'E' or 'B', LDVL >= N.

VR : REAL array, dimension (LDVR,M) [in]
> If JOB = 'E' or 'B', VR must contain right eigenvectors of
> (A, B), corresponding to the eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY
> and SELECT. The eigenvectors must be stored in consecutive
> columns ov VR, as returned by STGEVC.
> If JOB = 'V', VR is not referenced.

LDVR : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array VR. LDVR >= 1.
> If JOB = 'E' or 'B', LDVR >= N.

S : REAL array, dimension (MM) [out]
> If JOB = 'E' or 'B', the reciprocal condition numbers of the
> selected eigenvalues, stored in consecutive elements of the
> array. For a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues two
> consecutive elements of S are set to the same value. Thus
> S(j), DIF(j), and the j-th columns of VL and VR all
> correspond to the same eigenpair (but not in general the
> j-th eigenpair, unless all eigenpairs are selected).
> If JOB = 'V', S is not referenced.

DIF : REAL array, dimension (MM) [out]
> If JOB = 'V' or 'B', the estimated reciprocal condition
> numbers of the selected eigenvectors, stored in consecutive
> elements of the array. For a complex eigenvector two
> consecutive elements of DIF are set to the same value. If
> the eigenvalues cannot be reordered to compute DIF(j), DIF(j)
> is set to 0; this can only occur when the true value would be
> very small anyway.
> If JOB = 'E', DIF is not referenced.

MM : INTEGER [in]
> The number of elements in the arrays S and DIF. MM >= M.

M : INTEGER [out]
> The number of elements of the arrays S and DIF used to store
> the specified condition numbers; for each selected real
> eigenvalue one element is used, and for each selected complex
> conjugate pair of eigenvalues, two elements are used.
> If HOWMNY = 'A', M is set to N.

WORK : REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

LWORK : INTEGER [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,N).
> If JOB = 'V' or 'B' LWORK >= 2\*N\*(N+2)+16.
> 
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

IWORK : INTEGER array, dimension (N + 6) [out]
> If JOB = 'E', IWORK is not referenced.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> =0: Successful exit
> <0: If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
