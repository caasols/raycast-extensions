CHETRD_2STAGE reduces a complex Hermitian matrix A to real symmetric
tridiagonal form T by a unitary similarity transformation:
Q1\*\*H Q2\*\*H\* A \* Q2 \* Q1 = T.

## Parameters
VECT : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  No need for the Housholder representation,
> in particular for the second stage (Band to
> tridiagonal) and thus LHOUS2 is of size max(1, 4\*N);
> = 'V':  the Householder representation is needed to
> either generate Q1 Q2 or to apply Q1 Q2,
> then LHOUS2 is to be queried and computed.
> (NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS RELEASE).

UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
> = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N) [in,out]
> On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
> N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
> triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
> triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
> leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
> triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
> triangular part of A is not referenced.
> On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the band superdiagonal
> of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
> internal band-diagonal matrix AB, and the elements above
> the KD superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the unitary
> matrix Q1 as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
> = 'L', the diagonal and band subdiagonal of A are over-
> written by the corresponding elements of the internal band-diagonal
> matrix AB, and the elements below the KD subdiagonal, with
> the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix Q1 as a product
> of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

D : REAL array, dimension (N) [out]
> The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.

E : REAL array, dimension (N-1) [out]
> The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.

TAU : COMPLEX array, dimension (N-KD) [out]
> The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors of
> the first stage (see Further Details).

HOUS2 : COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LHOUS2)) [out]
> Stores the Householder representation of the stage2
> band to tridiagonal.

LHOUS2 : INTEGER [in]
> The dimension of the array HOUS2.
> LHOUS2 >= 1.
> 
> If LWORK = -1, or LHOUS2=-1,
> then a query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the HOUS2 array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the HOUS2 array, and no error
> message related to LHOUS2 is issued by XERBLA.
> If VECT='N', LHOUS2 = max(1, 4\*n);
> if VECT='V', option not yet available.

WORK : COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

LWORK : INTEGER [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.
> If N = 0, LWORK >= 1, else LWORK = MAX(1, dimension).
> 
> If LWORK = -1, or LHOUS2 = -1,
> then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
> LWORK = MAX(1, dimension) where
> dimension   = max(stage1,stage2) + (KD+1)\*N
> = N\*KD + N\*max(KD+1,FACTOPTNB)
> + max(2\*KD\*KD, KD\*NTHREADS)
> + (KD+1)\*N
> where KD is the blocking size of the reduction,
> FACTOPTNB is the blocking used by the QR or LQ
> algorithm, usually FACTOPTNB=128 is a good choice
> NTHREADS is the number of threads used when
> openMP compilation is enabled, otherwise =1.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
