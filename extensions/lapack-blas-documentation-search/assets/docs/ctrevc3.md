CTREVC3 computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
a complex upper triangular matrix T.
Matrices of this type are produced by the Schur factorization of
a complex general matrix:  A = Q\*T\*Q\*\*H, as computed by CHSEQR.

The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of T corresponding
to an eigenvalue w are defined by:

T\*x = w\*x,     (y\*\*H)\*T = w\*(y\*\*H)

where y\*\*H denotes the conjugate transpose of the vector y.
The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are read directly
from the diagonal of T.

This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
eigenvectors of T, or the products Q\*X and/or Q\*Y, where Q is an
input matrix. If Q is the unitary factor that reduces a matrix A to
Schur form T, then Q\*X and Q\*Y are the matrices of right and left
eigenvectors of A.

This uses a Level 3 BLAS version of the back transformation.

## Parameters
SIDE : CHARACTER\*1 [in]

> = 'L':  compute left eigenvectors only;
> = 'B':  compute both right and left eigenvectors.

HOWMNY : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'A':  compute all right and/or left eigenvectors;
> = 'B':  compute all right and/or left eigenvectors,

SELECT : LOGICAL array, dimension (N) [in]

> The upper triangular matrix T.  T is modified, but restored
> on exit.

LDT : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).

VL : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVL,MM) [in,out]
> On entry, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B' and HOWMNY = 'B', VL must

> Each selected eigenvector occupies one column.

WORK : COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) [out]

LWORK : INTEGER [in]

> For optimum performance, LWORK >= N + 2\*N\*NB, where NB is
> the optimal blocksize.
> 
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
