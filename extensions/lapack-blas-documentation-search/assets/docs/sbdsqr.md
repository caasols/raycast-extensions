SBDSQR computes the singular values and, optionally, the right and/or
left singular vectors from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of
a real N-by-N (upper or lower) bidiagonal matrix B using the implicit
zero-shift QR algorithm.  The SVD of B has the form

B = Q \* S \* P\*\*T

where S is the diagonal matrix of singular values, Q is an orthogonal
matrix of left singular vectors, and P is an orthogonal matrix of
right singular vectors.  If left singular vectors are requested, this
subroutine actually returns U\*Q instead of Q, and, if right singular
vectors are requested, this subroutine returns P\*\*T\*VT instead of
P\*\*T, for given real input matrices U and VT.  When U and VT are the
orthogonal matrices that reduce a general matrix A to bidiagonal
form:  A = U\*B\*VT, as computed by SGEBRD, then

A = (U\*Q) \* S \* (P\*\*T\*VT)

is the SVD of A.  Optionally, the subroutine may also compute Q\*\*T\*C
for a given real input matrix C.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'U':  B is upper bidiagonal;
> = 'L':  B is lower bidiagonal.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix B.  N >= 0.

NCVT : INTEGER [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix VT. NCVT >= 0.

NRU : INTEGER [in]

LDVT : INTEGER [in]

> iterations (in inner while loop)
> = 3, termination criterion of outer while loop not met
> (program created more than N unreduced blocks)
> else NCVT = NRU = NCC = 0,

> similar to the input matrix B;  if INFO = i, i
> elements of E have not converged to zero.
