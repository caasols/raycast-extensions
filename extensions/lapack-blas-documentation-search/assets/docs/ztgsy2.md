ZTGSY2 solves the generalized Sylvester equation

A \* R - L \* B = scale \* C               (1)
D \* R - L \* E = scale \* F

using Level 1 and 2 BLAS, where R and L are unknown M-by-N matrices,
(A, D), (B, E) and (C, F) are given matrix pairs of size M-by-M,
N-by-N and M-by-N, respectively. A, B, D and E are upper triangular
(i.e., (A,D) and (B,E) in generalized Schur form).

The solution (R, L) overwrites (C, F). 0 <= SCALE <= 1 is an output
scaling factor chosen to avoid overflow.

In matrix notation solving equation (1) corresponds to solve
Zx = scale \* b, where Z is defined as

Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B\*\*H, Im) ]             (2)
[ kron(In, D)  -kron(E\*\*H, Im) ],

Ik is the identity matrix of size k and X\*\*H is the conjugate transpose of X.
kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.

If TRANS = 'C', y in the conjugate transposed system Z\*\*H\*y = scale\*b
is solved for, which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

A\*\*H \* R  + D\*\*H \* L   = scale \* C           (3)
R  \* B\*\*H + L  \* E\*\*H  = scale \* -F

This case is used to compute an estimate of Dif[(A, D), (B, E)] =
= sigma_min(Z) using reverse communication with ZLACON.

ZTGSY2 also (IJOB >= 1) contributes to the computation in ZTGSYL
of an upper bound on the separation between to matrix pairs. Then
the input (A, D), (B, E) are sub-pencils of two matrix pairs in
ZTGSYL.
