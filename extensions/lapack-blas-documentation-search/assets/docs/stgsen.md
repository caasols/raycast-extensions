STGSEN reorders the generalized real Schur decomposition of a real
matrix pair (A, B) (in terms of an orthonormal equivalence trans-
formation Q\*\*T \* (A, B) \* Z), so that a selected cluster of eigenvalues
appears in the leading diagonal blocks of the upper quasi-triangular
matrix A and the upper triangular B. The leading columns of Q and
Z form orthonormal bases of the corresponding left and right eigen-
spaces (deflating subspaces). (A, B) must be in generalized real
Schur canonical form (as returned by SGGES), i.e. A is block upper
triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks. B is upper
triangular.

STGSEN also computes the generalized eigenvalues

w(j) = (ALPHAR(j) + i\*ALPHAI(j))/BETA(j)

of the reordered matrix pair (A, B).

Optionally, STGSEN computes the estimates of reciprocal condition
numbers for eigenvalues and eigenspaces. These are Difu[(A11,B11),
(A22,B22)] and Difl[(A11,B11), (A22,B22)], i.e. the separation(s)
between the matrix pairs (A11, B11) and (A22,B22) that correspond to
the selected cluster and the eigenvalues outside the cluster, resp.,
and norms of  onto left and right eigenspaces w.r.t.
the selected cluster in the (1,1)-block.

## Parameters
IJOB : INTEGER [in]
> Specifies whether condition numbers are required for the
> cluster of eigenvalues (PL and PR) or the deflating subspaces
> (Difu and Difl):
> =0: Only reorder w.r.t. SELECT. No extras.
> =1: Reciprocal of norms of  onto left and right
> eigenspaces w.r.t. the selected cluster (PL and PR).
> =2: Upper bounds on Difu and Difl. F-norm-based estimate
> (DIF(1:2)).
> =3: Estimate of Difu and Difl. 1-norm-based estimate
> (DIF(1:2)).
> About 5 times as expensive as IJOB = 2.
> =4: Compute PL, PR and DIF (i.e. 0, 1 and 2 above): Economic
> version to get it all.
> =5: Compute PL, PR and DIF (i.e. 0, 1 and 3 above)

WANTQ : LOGICAL [in]

> .FALSE.: do not update Z.

SELECT : LOGICAL array, dimension (N) [in]
> SELECT specifies the eigenvalues in the selected cluster.

> .TRUE.. To select a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues
> w(j) and w(j+1), corresponding to a 2-by-2 diagonal block,
> either SELECT(j) or SELECT(j+1) or both must be set to
> .TRUE.; a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues must be
> either both included in the cluster or both excluded.

A : REAL array, dimension(LDA,N) [in,out]

> and BETA(j),j=1,...,N  are the diagonals of the complex Schur
> form (S,T) that would result if the 2-by-2 diagonal blocks of
> the real generalized Schur form of (A,B) were further reduced
> to triangular form using complex unitary transformations.
> If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then the j-th eigenvalue is real; if

> 
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

IWORK : INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK)) [out]
