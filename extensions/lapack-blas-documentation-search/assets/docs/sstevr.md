SSTEVR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix T.  Eigenvalues and
eigenvectors can be selected by specifying either a range of values
or a range of indices for the desired eigenvalues.

Whenever possible, SSTEVR calls SSTEMR to compute the
eigenspectrum using Relatively Robust Representations.  SSTEMR
computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
eigenvectors are computed from various  L D L^T representations
(also known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization is avoided as far as possible. More specifically,
the various steps of the algorithm are as follows. For the i-th
unreduced block of T,
(a) Compute T - sigma_i = L_i D_i L_i^T, such that L_i D_i L_i^T
is a relatively robust representation,
(b) Compute the eigenvalues, lambda_j, of L_i D_i L_i^T to high
relative accuracy by the dqds algorithm,
(c) If there is a cluster of close eigenvalues,  sigma_i
close to the cluster, and go to step (a),
(d) Given the approximate eigenvalue lambda_j of L_i D_i L_i^T,
compute the corresponding eigenvector by forming a
rank-revealing twisted factorization.
The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input
parameter ABSTOL.

Note 1 : SSTEVR calls SSTEMR when the full spectrum is requested
on machines which conform to the ieee-754 floating point standard.
SSTEVR calls SSTEBZ and SSTEIN on non-ieee machines and
when partial spectrum requests are made.

Normal execution of SSTEMR may create NaNs and infinities and
hence may abort due to a floating point exception in environments
which do not handle NaNs and infinities in the ieee standard default
manner.

## Parameters
JOBZ : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
> = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

RANGE : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'A': all eigenvalues will be found.
> = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
> will be found.
> = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
> For RANGE = 'V' or 'I' and IU - IL < N - 1, SSTEBZ and
> SSTEIN are called

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.

D : REAL array, dimension (N) [in,out]
> On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
> A.
> On exit, D may be multiplied by a constant factor chosen
> to avoid over/underflow in computing the eigenvalues.

E : REAL array, dimension (max(1,N-1)) [in,out]
> On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
> matrix A in elements 1 to N-1 of E.
