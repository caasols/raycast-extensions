```fortran
subroutine cpotf2 (
        character uplo,
        integer n,
        complex, dimension( lda, * ) a,
        integer lda,
        integer info
)
```

CPOTF2 computes the Cholesky factorization of a complex Hermitian
positive definite matrix A.

The factorization has the form
A = U\*\*H \* U ,  if UPLO = 'U', or
A = L  \* L\*\*H,  if UPLO = 'L',
where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
> Hermitian matrix A is stored.
> = 'U':  Upper triangular
> = 'L':  Lower triangular

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N) [in,out]
> On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
> n by n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
> triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
> triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
> leading n by n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
> triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
> triangular part of A is not referenced.
> 
> On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
> factorization A = U\*\*H \*U  or A = L\*L\*\*H.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0: if INFO = k, the leading principal minor of order k
> is not positive, and the factorization could not be
> completed.
