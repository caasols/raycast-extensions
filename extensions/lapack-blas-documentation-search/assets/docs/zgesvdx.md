ZGESVDX computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a complex
M-by-N matrix A, optionally computing the left and/or right singular
vectors. The SVD is written

A = U \* SIGMA \* transpose(V)

where SIGMA is an M-by-N matrix which is zero except for its
min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is an M-by-M unitary matrix, and
V is an N-by-N unitary matrix.  The diagonal elements of SIGMA
are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and
are returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of
U and V are the left and right singular vectors of A.

ZGESVDX uses an eigenvalue problem for obtaining the SVD, which
allows for the computation of a subset of singular values and
vectors. See DBDSVDX for details.

Note that the routine returns V\*\*T, not V.

## Parameters
JOBU : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies options for computing all or part of the matrix U:
> = 'V':  the first min(m,n) columns of U (the left singular
> vectors) or as specified by RANGE are returned in
> the array U;
> = 'N':  no columns of U (no left singular vectors) are
> computed.

JOBVT : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies options for computing all or part of the matrix
> V\*\*T:
> = 'V':  the first min(m,n) rows of V\*\*T (the right singular
> vectors) or as specified by RANGE are returned in
> the array VT;
> = 'N':  no rows of V\*\*T (no right singular vectors) are
> computed.

RANGE : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'A': all singular values will be found.
> = 'V': all singular values in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
> will be found.
> = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th singular values will be found.

M : INTEGER [in]
> The number of rows of the input matrix A.  M >= 0.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The number of columns of the input matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension (LDA,N) [in,out]
> On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).

VL : DOUBLE PRECISION [in]

IU : INTEGER [in]
> If RANGE='I', the index of the
> largest singular value to be returned.
> 1 <= IL <= IU <= min(M,N), if min(M,N) > 0.
> Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.

NS : INTEGER [out]
> The total number of singular values found,
> 0 <= NS <= min(M,N).
> If RANGE = 'A', NS = min(M,N); if RANGE = 'I', NS = IU-IL+1.

S : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(M,N)) [out]
> The singular values of A, sorted so that S(i) >= S(i+1).

U : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension (LDU,UCOL) [out]
> If JOBU = 'V', U contains columns of U (the left singular
> vectors, stored columnwise) as specified by RANGE; if
> JOBU = 'N', U is not referenced.
> Note: The user must ensure that UCOL >= NS; if RANGE = 'V',

> Note: The user must ensure that LDVT >= NS; if RANGE = 'V',
> the exact value of NS is not known in advance and an upper

LDVT : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array VT.  LDVT >= 1; if
> JOBVT = 'V', LDVT >= NS (see above).

WORK : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) [out]
> On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK;

LWORK : INTEGER [in]

> comments inside the code):
> - PATH 1  (M much larger than N)
> - PATH 1t (N much larger than M)
> LWORK >= MAX(1,MIN(M,N)\*2+MAX(M,N)) for the other paths.
> For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.
> 
> If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
> only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
> this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
> message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

RWORK : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LRWORK)) [out]

IWORK : INTEGER array, dimension (12\*MIN(M,N)) [out]

> to converge in DBDSVDX/DSTEVX.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0:  if INFO = i, then i eigenvectors failed to converge
> in DBDSVDX/DSTEVX.
> if INFO = N\*2 + 1, an internal error occurred in
> DBDSVDX
