ZTREVC computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
a complex upper triangular matrix T.
Matrices of this type are produced by the Schur factorization of
a complex general matrix:  A = Q\*T\*Q\*\*H, as computed by ZHSEQR.

The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of T corresponding
to an eigenvalue w are defined by:

T\*x = w\*x,     (y\*\*H)\*T = w\*(y\*\*H)

where y\*\*H denotes the conjugate transpose of the vector y.
The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are read directly
from the diagonal of T.

This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
eigenvectors of T, or the products Q\*X and/or Q\*Y, where Q is an
input matrix.  If Q is the unitary factor that reduces a matrix A to
Schur form T, then Q\*X and Q\*Y are the matrices of right and left
eigenvectors of A.

## Parameters
SIDE : CHARACTER\*1 [in]

> = 'L':  compute left eigenvectors only;
> = 'B':  compute both right and left eigenvectors.

HOWMNY : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'A':  compute all right and/or left eigenvectors;
> = 'B':  compute all right and/or left eigenvectors,
> backtransformed using the matrices supplied in
> VR and/or VL;
> = 'S':  compute selected right and/or left eigenvectors,
> as indicated by the logical array SELECT.

SELECT : LOGICAL array, dimension (N) [in]
> If HOWMNY = 'S', SELECT specifies the eigenvectors to be

VL : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension (LDVL,MM) [in,out]
> On entry, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B' and HOWMNY = 'B', VL must

M : INTEGER [out]
> The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR actually
> used to store the eigenvectors.  If HOWMNY = 'A' or 'B', M
> is set to N.  Each selected eigenvector occupies one
> column.

WORK : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension (2\*N) [out]

RWORK : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N) [out]
