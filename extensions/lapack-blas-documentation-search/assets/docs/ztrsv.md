subroutine ztrsv (
        character uplo,
        character trans,
        character diag,
        integer n,
        complex*16, dimension(lda,*) a,

```

ZTRSV  solves one of the systems of equations

A\*x = b,   or   A\*\*T\*x = b,   or   A\*\*H\*x = b,

where b and x are n element vectors and A is an n by n unit, or
non-unit, upper or lower triangular matrix.

No test for singularity or near-singularity is included in this
routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or
> lower triangular matrix as follows:
> 
> UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.
> 
> UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.

TRANS : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> On entry, TRANS specifies the equations to be solved as
> follows:
> 
> TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   A\*x = b.
> 
> TRANS = 'T' or 't'   A\*\*T\*x = b.
> 
> TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   A\*\*H\*x = b.

DIAG : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit
> triangular as follows:
> 
> DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.
> 
> DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
> triangular.

N : INTEGER [in]
> On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
> N must be at least zero.

A : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension ( LDA, N ) [in]
> Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n
> upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper
> triangular matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of
> A is not referenced.
> Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n
> lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower
> triangular matrix and the strictly upper triangular part of
> A is not referenced.
> Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of
> A are not referenced either, but are assumed to be unity.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
> in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
> max( 1, n ).

X : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension at least [in,out]
> ( 1 + ( n - 1 )\*abs( INCX ) ).
> Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
> element right-hand side vector b. On exit, X is overwritten
> with the solution vector x.

INCX : INTEGER [in]
> On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
> X. INCX must not be zero.
