SLAQR0 computes the eigenvalues of a Hessenberg matrix H
and, optionally, the matrices T and Z from the Schur decomposition
H = Z T Z\*\*T, where T is an upper quasi-triangular matrix (the
Schur form), and Z is the orthogonal matrix of Schur vectors.

Optionally Z may be postmultiplied into an input orthogonal
matrix Q so that this routine can give the Schur factorization
of a matrix A which has been reduced to the Hessenberg form H
by the orthogonal matrix Q:  A = Q\*H\*Q\*\*T = (QZ)\*T\*(QZ)\*\*T.

## Parameters
WANTT : LOGICAL [in]
> = .TRUE. : the full Schur form T is required;
> = .FALSE.: only eigenvalues are required.

WANTZ : LOGICAL [in]
> = .TRUE. : the matrix of Schur vectors Z is required;
> = .FALSE.: Schur vectors are not required.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix H.  N >= 0.

ILO : INTEGER [in]

IHI : INTEGER [in]
> It is assumed that H is already upper triangular in rows
> and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N and, if ILO > 1,
> H(ILO,ILO-1) is zero. ILO and IHI are normally set by a
> previous call to SGEBAL, and then passed to SGEHRD when the
> matrix output by SGEBAL is reduced to Hessenberg form.
> Otherwise, ILO and IHI should be set to 1 and N,
> respectively.  If N > 0, then 1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N.
> If N = 0, then ILO = 1 and IHI = 0.

H : REAL array, dimension (LDH,N) [in,out]
> On entry, the upper Hessenberg matrix H.
> On exit, if INFO = 0 and WANTT is .TRUE., then H contains
> the upper quasi-triangular matrix T from the Schur
> decomposition (the Schur form); 2-by-2 diagonal blocks
> (corresponding to complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues)
> are returned in standard form, with H(i,i) = H(i+1,i+1)
> and H(i+1,i)\*H(i,i+1) < 0. If INFO = 0 and WANTT is
> .FALSE., then the contents of H are unspecified on exit.
> (The output value of H when INFO > 0 is given under the
> description of INFO below.)
> 
> This subroutine may explicitly set H(i,j) = 0 for i > j and
> j = 1, 2, ... ILO-1 or j = IHI+1, IHI+2, ... N.

LDH : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array H. LDH >= max(1,N).

WR : REAL array, dimension (IHI) [out]

WI : REAL array, dimension (IHI) [out]
> The real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the computed
> eigenvalues of H(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI) are stored in WR(ILO:IHI)
> and WI(ILO:IHI). If two eigenvalues are computed as a
> complex conjugate pair, they are stored in consecutive
> elements of WR and WI, say the i-th and (i+1)th, with
> WI(i) > 0 and WI(i+1) < 0. If WANTT is .TRUE., then
> the eigenvalues are stored in the same order as on the
> diagonal of the Schur form returned in H, with
> WR(i) = H(i,i) and, if H(i:i+1,i:i+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal
> block, WI(i) = sqrt(-H(i+1,i)\*H(i,i+1)) and
> WI(i+1) = -WI(i).

ILOZ : INTEGER [in]

IHIZ : INTEGER [in]
> Specify the rows of Z to which transformations must be
> applied if WANTZ is .TRUE..
> 1 <= ILOZ <= ILO; IHI <= IHIZ <= N.

Z : REAL array, dimension (LDZ,IHI) [in,out]
> If WANTZ is .FALSE., then Z is not referenced.
> If WANTZ is .TRUE., then Z(ILO:IHI,ILOZ:IHIZ) is
> replaced by Z(ILO:IHI,ILOZ:IHIZ)\*U where U is the
> orthogonal Schur factor of H(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI).
> (The output value of Z when INFO > 0 is given under
> the description of INFO below.)

LDZ : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array Z.  if WANTZ is .TRUE.
> then LDZ >= MAX(1,IHIZ).  Otherwise, LDZ >= 1.

WORK : REAL array, dimension LWORK [out]
> On exit, if LWORK = -1, WORK(1) returns an estimate of
> the optimal value for LWORK.

LWORK : INTEGER [in]
> The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,N)
> is sufficient, but LWORK typically as large as 6\*N may
> be required for optimal performance.  A workspace query
> to determine the optimal workspace size is recommended.
> 
> If LWORK = -1, then SLAQR0 does a workspace query.
> In this case, SLAQR0 checks the input parameters and
> estimates the optimal workspace size for the given
> values of N, ILO and IHI.  The estimate is returned
> in WORK(1).  No error message related to LWORK is
> issued by XERBLA.  Neither H nor Z are accessed.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> > 0:  if INFO = i, SLAQR0 failed to compute all of
> the eigenvalues.  Elements 1:ilo-1 and i+1:n of WR
> and WI contain those eigenvalues which have been
> successfully computed.  (Failures are rare.)
> 
> If INFO > 0 and WANT is .FALSE., then on exit,
> the remaining unconverged eigenvalues are the eigen-
> values of the upper Hessenberg matrix rows and
> columns ILO through INFO of the final, output
> value of H.
> 
> If INFO > 0 and WANTT is .TRUE., then on exit
> 
> (\*)  (initial value of H)\*U  = U\*(final value of H)
> 
> where U is an orthogonal matrix.  The final
> value of H is upper Hessenberg and quasi-triangular
> in rows and columns INFO+1 through IHI.
> 
> If INFO > 0 and WANTZ is .TRUE., then on exit
> 
> (final value of Z(ILO:IHI,ILOZ:IHIZ)
