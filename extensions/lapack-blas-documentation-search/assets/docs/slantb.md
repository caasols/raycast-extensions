real function slantb (
        character norm,
        character uplo,
        character diag,
        integer n,
        integer k,

SLANTB  returns the value of the one norm,  or the Frobenius norm, or
the  infinity norm,  or the element of  largest absolute value  of an
n by n triangular band matrix A,  with ( k + 1 ) diagonals.

## Parameters
NORM : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies the value to be returned in SLANTB as described
> above.

UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the matrix A is upper or lower triangular.
> = 'U':  Upper triangular
> = 'L':  Lower triangular

DIAG : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether or not the matrix A is unit triangular.
> = 'N':  Non-unit triangular
> = 'U':  Unit triangular

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  When N = 0, SLANTB is
> set to zero.

K : INTEGER [in]
> The number of super-diagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
> or the number of sub-diagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'L'.
> K >= 0.

AB : REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N) [in]
> The upper or lower triangular band matrix A, stored in the
> first k+1 rows of AB.  The j-th column of A is stored
> in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', AB(k+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-k)<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)   = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+k).
> Note that when DIAG = 'U', the elements of the array AB
> corresponding to the diagonal elements of the matrix A are
> not referenced, but are assumed to be one.

LDAB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= K+1.

WORK : REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)), [out]
> where LWORK >= N when NORM = 'I'; otherwise, WORK is not
> referenced.
