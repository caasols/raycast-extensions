```fortran
subroutine chpr (
        character uplo,
        integer n,
        real alpha,
        complex, dimension(*) x,
        integer incx,
        complex, dimension(*) ap
)
```

CHPR    performs the hermitian rank 1 operation

A := alpha\*x\*x\*\*H + A,

where alpha is a real scalar, x is an n element vector and A is an
n by n hermitian matrix, supplied in packed form.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
> triangular part of the matrix A is supplied in the packed
> array AP as follows:
> 
> UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   The upper triangular part of A is
> supplied in AP.
> 
> UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   The lower triangular part of A is
> supplied in AP.

N : INTEGER [in]
> On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
> N must be at least zero.

ALPHA : REAL [in]
> On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.

X : COMPLEX array, dimension at least [in]
> ( 1 + ( n - 1 )\*abs( INCX ) ).
> Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
> element vector x.

INCX : INTEGER [in]
> On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
> X. INCX must not be zero.

AP : COMPLEX array, dimension at least [in,out]
> ( ( n\*( n + 1 ) )/2 ).
> Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the array AP must
> contain the upper triangular part of the hermitian matrix
> packed sequentially, column by column, so that AP( 1 )
> contains a( 1, 1 ), AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 1, 2 )
> and a( 2, 2 ) respectively, and so on. On exit, the array
> AP is overwritten by the upper triangular part of the
> updated matrix.
> Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the array AP must
> contain the lower triangular part of the hermitian matrix
> packed sequentially, column by column, so that AP( 1 )
> contains a( 1, 1 ), AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 2, 1 )
> and a( 3, 1 ) respectively, and so on. On exit, the array
> AP is overwritten by the lower triangular part of the
> updated matrix.
> Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need
> not be set, they are assumed to be zero, and on exit they
> are set to zero.
