DGGHD3 reduces a pair of real matrices (A,B) to generalized upper
Hessenberg form using orthogonal transformations, where A is a
general matrix and B is upper triangular.  The form of the
generalized eigenvalue problem is
A\*x = lambda\*B\*x,
and B is typically made upper triangular by computing its QR
factorization and moving the orthogonal matrix Q to the left side
of the equation.

This subroutine simultaneously reduces A to a Hessenberg matrix H:
Q\*\*T\*A\*Z = H
and transforms B to another upper triangular matrix T:
Q\*\*T\*B\*Z = T
in order to reduce the problem to its standard form
H\*y = lambda\*T\*y
where y = Z\*\*T\*x.

The orthogonal matrices Q and Z are determined as products of Givens
rotations.  They may either be formed explicitly, or they may be
postmultiplied into input matrices Q1 and Z1, so that

Q1 \* A \* Z1\*\*T = (Q1\*Q) \* H \* (Z1\*Z)\*\*T

Q1 \* B \* Z1\*\*T = (Q1\*Q) \* T \* (Z1\*Z)\*\*T

If Q1 is the orthogonal matrix from the QR factorization of B in the
original equation A\*x = lambda\*B\*x, then DGGHD3 reduces the original
problem to generalized Hessenberg form.

This is a blocked variant of DGGHRD, using matrix-matrix
multiplications for parts of the computation to enhance performance.
