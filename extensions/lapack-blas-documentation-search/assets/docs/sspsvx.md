SSPSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization A = U\*D\*U\*\*T or
A = L\*D\*L\*\*T to compute the solution to a real system of linear
equations A \* X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix stored
in packed format and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
provided.

## Parameters
FACT : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether or not the factored form of A has been
> supplied on entry.
> = 'F':  On entry, AFP and IPIV contain the factored form of
> A.  AP, AFP and IPIV will not be modified.
> = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AFP and factored.

UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
> = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
> matrix A.  N >= 0.

NRHS : INTEGER [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
> of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.

AP : REAL array, dimension (N\*(N+1)/2) [in]
> The upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix A, packed
> columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored
> in the array AP as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)\*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)\*(2\*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
> See below for further details.

AFP : REAL array, dimension (N\*(N+1)/2) [in,out]
> If FACT = 'F', then AFP is an input argument and on entry
> contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
> to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
> A = U\*D\*U\*\*T or A = L\*D\*L\*\*T as computed by SSPTRF, stored as
> a packed triangular matrix in the same storage format as A.
> 
> If FACT = 'N', then AFP is an output argument and on exit
> contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
> to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
> A = U\*D\*U\*\*T or A = L\*D\*L\*\*T as computed by SSPTRF, stored as
> a packed triangular matrix in the same storage format as A.

IPIV : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [in,out]
> If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
> contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
> of D, as determined by SSPTRF.
> If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
> interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
> If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
> columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
> is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
> IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
> interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
> 
> If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
> contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
> of D, as determined by SSPTRF.

B : REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS) [in]
> The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.

LDB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

X : REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS) [out]
> If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.

LDX : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).

RCOND : REAL [out]
> The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
> A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
> particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
> precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
> INFO > 0.

FERR : REAL array, dimension (NRHS) [out]
> The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
> X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
> If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
> is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
> element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
> largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
> the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
> overestimate of the true error.

BERR : REAL array, dimension (NRHS) [out]
> The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
> vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
> any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

WORK : REAL array, dimension (3\*N) [out]

IWORK : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [out]

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
> <= N:  D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
> has been completed but the factor D is exactly
> singular, so the solution and error bounds could
> not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
> = N+1: D is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
> precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
> to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
> solution and error bounds are computed because
> there are a number of situations where the
> computed solution can be more accurate than the
> value of RCOND would suggest.
