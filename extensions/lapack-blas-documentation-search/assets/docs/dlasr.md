DLASR applies a sequence of plane rotations to a real matrix A,
from either the left or the right.

When SIDE = 'L', the transformation takes the form

A := P\*A

and when SIDE = 'R', the transformation takes the form

A := A\*P\*\*T

where P is an orthogonal matrix consisting of a sequence of z plane
rotations, with z = M when SIDE = 'L' and z = N when SIDE = 'R',
and P\*\*T is the transpose of P.

When DIRECT = 'F' (Forward sequence), then

P = P(z-1) \* ... \* P(2) \* P(1)

and when DIRECT = 'B' (Backward sequence), then

P = P(1) \* P(2) \* ... \* P(z-1)

where P(k) is a plane rotation matrix defined by the 2-by-2 rotation

R(k) = (  c(k)  s(k) )
= ( -s(k)  c(k) ).

When PIVOT = 'V' (Variable pivot), the rotation is performed
for the plane (k,k+1), i.e., P(k) has the form

P(k) = (  1                                            )
(       ...                                     )
(              1                                )
(                   c(k)  s(k)                  )
(                  -s(k)  c(k)                  )
(                                1              )
(                                     ...       )
(                                            1  )

where R(k) appears as a rank-2 modification to the identity matrix in
rows and columns k and k+1.

When PIVOT = 'T' (Top pivot), the rotation is performed for the
plane (1,k+1), so P(k) has the form

P(k) = (  c(k)                    s(k)                 )
(         1                                     )
(              ...                              )
(                     1                         )
( -s(k)                    c(k)                 )
(                                 1             )
(                                      ...      )
(                                             1 )

where R(k) appears in rows and columns 1 and k+1.

Similarly, when PIVOT = 'B' (Bottom pivot), the rotation is
performed for the plane (k,z), giving P(k) the form

P(k) = ( 1                                             )
(      ...                                      )
(             1                                 )
(                  c(k)                    s(k) )
(                         1                     )
(                              ...              )
(                                     1         )
(                 -s(k)                    c(k) )

where R(k) appears in rows and columns k and z.  The rotations are
performed without ever forming P(k) explicitly.
