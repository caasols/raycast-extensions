DLATBS solves one of the triangular systems

A \*x = s\*b  or  A\*\*T\*x = s\*b

with scaling to prevent overflow, where A is an upper or lower
triangular band matrix.  Here A\*\*T denotes the transpose of A, x and b
are n-element vectors, and s is a scaling factor, usually less than
or equal to 1, chosen so that the components of x will be less than
the overflow threshold.  If the unscaled problem will not cause
overflow, the Level 2 BLAS routine DTBSV is called.  If the matrix A
is singular (A(j,j) = 0 for some j), then s is set to 0 and a
non-trivial solution to A\*x = 0 is returned.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the matrix A is upper or lower triangular.
> = 'U':  Upper triangular
> = 'L':  Lower triangular

TRANS : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies the operation applied to A.
> = 'N':  Solve A \* x = s\*b  (No transpose)
> = 'T':  Solve A\*\*T\* x = s\*b  (Transpose)
> = 'C':  Solve A\*\*T\* x = s\*b  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

DIAG : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether or not the matrix A is unit triangular.
> = 'N':  Non-unit triangular
> = 'U':  Unit triangular

NORMIN : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether CNORM has been set or not.
> = 'Y':  CNORM contains the column norms on entry
> = 'N':  CNORM is not set on entry.  On exit, the norms will
> be computed and stored in CNORM.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

KD : INTEGER [in]
> The number of subdiagonals or superdiagonals in the
> triangular matrix A.  KD >= 0.

AB : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N) [in]
> The upper or lower triangular band matrix A, stored in the
> first KD+1 rows of the array. The j-th column of A is stored
> in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).

LDAB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.

X : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N) [in,out]
> On entry, the right hand side b of the triangular system.
> On exit, X is overwritten by the solution vector x.

SCALE : DOUBLE PRECISION [out]
> The scaling factor s for the triangular system
> A \* x = s\*b  or  A\*\*T\* x = s\*b.
> If SCALE = 0, the matrix A is singular or badly scaled, and
> the vector x is an exact or approximate solution to A\*x = 0.

CNORM : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N) [in,out]
> 
> If NORMIN = 'Y', CNORM is an input argument and CNORM(j)
> contains the norm of the off-diagonal part of the j-th column
> of A.  If TRANS = 'N', CNORM(j) must be greater than or equal
> to the infinity-norm, and if TRANS = 'T' or 'C', CNORM(j)
> must be greater than or equal to the 1-norm.
> 
> If NORMIN = 'N', CNORM is an output argument and CNORM(j)
> returns the 1-norm of the offdiagonal part of the j-th column
> of A.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
