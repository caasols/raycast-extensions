SSPEVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
of a real symmetric matrix A in packed storage.  Eigenvalues/vectors
can be selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
indices for the desired eigenvalues.

## Parameters
JOBZ : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
> = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

RANGE : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'A': all eigenvalues will be found;
> = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
> will be found;
> = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.

UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
> = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

AP : REAL array, dimension (N\*(N+1)/2) [in,out]
> On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
> A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
> is stored in the array AP as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)\*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)\*(2\*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
> 
> On exit, AP is overwritten by values generated during the
> reduction to tridiagonal form.  If UPLO = 'U', the diagonal
> and first superdiagonal of the tridiagonal matrix T overwrite
> the corresponding elements of A, and if UPLO = 'L', the
> diagonal and first subdiagonal of T overwrite the
> corresponding elements of A.

VL : REAL [in]
> If RANGE='V', the lower bound of the interval to
> be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.
> Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.

VU : REAL [in]
> If RANGE='V', the upper bound of the interval to
> be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.
> Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.

IL : INTEGER [in]
> If RANGE='I', the index of the
> smallest eigenvalue to be returned.
> 1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
> Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.

IU : INTEGER [in]
> If RANGE='I', the index of the
> largest eigenvalue to be returned.
> 1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
> Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.

ABSTOL : REAL [in]
> The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
> An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
> when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
> of width less than or equal to
> 
> ABSTOL + EPS \*   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
> 
> where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
> or equal to zero, then  EPS\*|T|  will be used in its place,
> where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
> by reducing AP to tridiagonal form.
> 
> Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
> set to twice the underflow threshold 2\*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.
> If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
> eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
> 2\*SLAMCH('S').
> 
> See  by Demmel and
> Kahan, LAPACK Working Note #3.

M : INTEGER [out]
> The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
> If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.

W : REAL array, dimension (N) [out]
> If INFO = 0, the selected eigenvalues in ascending order.

Z : REAL array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M)) [out]
> If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
> contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
> corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
> column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
> If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
> contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
> index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
> If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
> Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
> supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
> is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.

LDZ : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
> JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).

WORK : REAL array, dimension (8\*N) [out]

IWORK : INTEGER array, dimension (5\*N) [out]

IFAIL : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [out]
> If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
> IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
> indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
> If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0:  if INFO = i, then i eigenvectors failed to converge.
> Their indices are stored in array IFAIL.
