double precision function zlantr (
        character norm,
        character uplo,
        character diag,
        integer m,
        integer n,
        complex*16, dimension( lda, * ) a,
        integer lda,

```

ZLANTR  returns the value of the one norm,  or the Frobenius norm, or
the  infinity norm,  or the  element of  largest absolute value  of a
trapezoidal or triangular matrix A.

## Parameters
NORM : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies the value to be returned in ZLANTR as described
> above.

UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the matrix A is upper or lower trapezoidal.
> = 'U':  Upper trapezoidal
> = 'L':  Lower trapezoidal
> Note that A is triangular instead of trapezoidal if M = N.

DIAG : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether or not the matrix A has unit diagonal.
> = 'N':  Non-unit diagonal
> = 'U':  Unit diagonal

M : INTEGER [in]
> The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0, and if
> UPLO = 'U', M <= N.  When M = 0, ZLANTR is set to zero.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0, and if
> UPLO = 'L', N <= M.  When N = 0, ZLANTR is set to zero.

A : COMPLEX\*16 array, dimension (LDA,N) [in]
> The trapezoidal matrix A (A is triangular if M = N).
> If UPLO = 'U', the leading m by n upper trapezoidal part of
> the array A contains the upper trapezoidal matrix, and the
> strictly lower triangular part of A is not referenced.
> If UPLO = 'L', the leading m by n lower trapezoidal part of
> the array A contains the lower trapezoidal matrix, and the
> strictly upper triangular part of A is not referenced.  Note
> that when DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not
> referenced and are assumed to be one.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(M,1).

WORK : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)), [out]
> where LWORK >= M when NORM = 'I'; otherwise, WORK is not
> referenced.
