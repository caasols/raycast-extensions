DTBCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a
triangular band matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm.

The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for
norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is
computed as
RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) \* norm(inv(A)) ).

## Parameters
NORM : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
> infinity-norm condition number is required:
> = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
> = 'I':         Infinity-norm.

UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
> = 'L':  A is lower triangular.

DIAG : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
> = 'U':  A is unit triangular.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

KD : INTEGER [in]
> The number of superdiagonals or subdiagonals of the
> triangular band matrix A.  KD >= 0.

AB : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N) [in]
> The upper or lower triangular band matrix A, stored in the
> first kd+1 rows of the array. The j-th column of A is stored
> in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
> If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
> and are assumed to be 1.

LDAB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.

RCOND : DOUBLE PRECISION [out]
> The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
> computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) \* norm(inv(A))).

WORK : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3\*N) [out]

IWORK : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [out]

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
