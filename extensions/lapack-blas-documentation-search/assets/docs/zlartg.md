```fortran
subroutine zlartg (
        complex(wp) f,

ZLARTG generates a plane rotation so that

[  C         S  ] . [ F ]  =  [ R ]
[ -conjg(S)  C  ]   [ G ]     [ 0 ]

where C is real and C\*\*2 + |S|\*\*2 = 1.

The mathematical formulas used for C and S are

sgn(x) = {  x / |x|,   x != 0
{  1,         x  = 0

R = sgn(F) \* sqrt(|F|\*\*2 + |G|\*\*2)

C = |F| / sqrt(|F|\*\*2 + |G|\*\*2)

S = sgn(F) \* conjg(G) / sqrt(|F|\*\*2 + |G|\*\*2)

Special conditions:
If G=0, then C=1 and S=0.
If F=0, then C=0 and S is chosen so that R is real.

When F and G are real, the formulas simplify to C = F/R and
S = G/R, and the returned values of C, S, and R should be
identical to those returned by DLARTG.

The algorithm used to compute these quantities incorporates scaling
to avoid overflow or underflow in computing the square root of the
sum of squares.

This is the same routine ZROTG fom BLAS1, except that
F and G are unchanged on return.

Below, wp=>dp stands for double precision from LA_CONSTANTS module.
