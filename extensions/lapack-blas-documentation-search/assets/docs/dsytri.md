        character uplo,

DSYTRI computes the inverse of a real symmetric indefinite matrix
A using the factorization A = U\*D\*U\*\*T or A = L\*D\*L\*\*T computed by
DSYTRF.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
> as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
> = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U\*D\*U\*\*T;
> = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L\*D\*L\*\*T.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N) [in,out]
> On entry, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
> used to obtain the factor U or L as computed by DSYTRF.
> 
> On exit, if INFO = 0, the (symmetric) inverse of the original
> matrix.  If UPLO = 'U', the upper triangular part of the
> inverse is formed and the part of A below the diagonal is not
> referenced; if UPLO = 'L' the lower triangular part of the
> inverse is formed and the part of A above the diagonal is
> not referenced.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

IPIV : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [in]
> Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
> as determined by DSYTRF.

WORK : DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N) [out]

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) = 0; the matrix is singular and its
> inverse could not be computed.
