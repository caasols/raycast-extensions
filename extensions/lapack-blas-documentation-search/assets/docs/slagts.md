SLAGTS may be used to solve one of the systems of equations

(T - lambda\*I)\*x = y   or   (T - lambda\*I)\*\*T\*x = y,

where T is an n by n tridiagonal matrix, for x, following the
factorization of (T - lambda\*I) as

(T - lambda\*I) = P\*L\*U ,

by routine SLAGTF. The choice of equation to be solved is
controlled by the argument JOB, and in each case there is an option
to perturb zero or very small diagonal elements of U, this option
being intended for use in applications such as inverse iteration.

## Parameters
JOB : INTEGER [in]
> Specifies the job to be performed by SLAGTS as follows:
> =  1: The equations  (T - lambda\*I)x = y  are to be solved,
> but diagonal elements of U are not to be perturbed.
> = -1: The equations  (T - lambda\*I)x = y  are to be solved
> and, if overflow would otherwise occur, the diagonal
> elements of U are to be perturbed. See argument TOL
> below.
> =  2: The equations  (T - lambda\*I)\*\*Tx = y  are to be solved,
> but diagonal elements of U are not to be perturbed.
> = -2: The equations  (T - lambda\*I)\*\*Tx = y  are to be solved
> and, if overflow would otherwise occur, the diagonal
> elements of U are to be perturbed. See argument TOL
> below.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix T.

A : REAL array, dimension (N) [in]
> On entry, A must contain the diagonal elements of U as
> returned from SLAGTF.

B : REAL array, dimension (N-1) [in]
> On entry, B must contain the first super-diagonal elements of
> U as returned from SLAGTF.

C : REAL array, dimension (N-1) [in]
> On entry, C must contain the sub-diagonal elements of L as
> returned from SLAGTF.

D : REAL array, dimension (N-2) [in]
> On entry, D must contain the second super-diagonal elements
> of U as returned from SLAGTF.

IN : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [in]
> On entry, IN must contain details of the matrix P as returned
> from SLAGTF.

Y : REAL array, dimension (N) [in,out]
> On entry, the right hand side vector y.
> On exit, Y is overwritten by the solution vector x.

TOL : REAL [in,out]
> On entry, with  JOB < 0, TOL should be the minimum
> perturbation to be made to very small diagonal elements of U.
> TOL should normally be chosen as about eps\*norm(U), where eps
> is the relative machine precision, but if TOL is supplied as
> non-positive, then it is reset to eps\*max( abs( u(i,j) ) ).
> If  JOB > 0  then TOL is not referenced.
> 
> On exit, TOL is changed as described above, only if TOL is
> non-positive on entry. Otherwise TOL is unchanged.

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0: overflow would occur when computing the INFO(th)
> element of the solution vector x. This can only occur
> when JOB is supplied as positive and either means
> that a diagonal element of U is very small, or that
> the elements of the right-hand side vector y are very
> large.
