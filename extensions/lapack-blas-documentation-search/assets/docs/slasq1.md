SLASQ1 computes the singular values of a real N-by-N bidiagonal
matrix with diagonal D and off-diagonal E. The singular values
are computed to high relative accuracy, in the absence of
denormalization, underflow and overflow. The algorithm was first
presented in

by K. V.
Fernando and B. N. Parlett, Numer. Math., Vol-67, No. 2, pp. 191-230,
1994,

and the present implementation is described in , LAPACK Working Note.

## Parameters
N : INTEGER [in]
> The number of rows and columns in the matrix. N >= 0.

D : REAL array, dimension (N) [in,out]
> On entry, D contains the diagonal elements of the
> bidiagonal matrix whose SVD is desired. On normal exit,
> D contains the singular values in decreasing order.

E : REAL array, dimension (N) [in,out]
> On entry, elements E(1:N-1) contain the off-diagonal elements
> of the bidiagonal matrix whose SVD is desired.
> On exit, E is overwritten.

WORK : REAL array, dimension (4\*N) [out]

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0: successful exit
> < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
> > 0: the algorithm failed
> = 1, a split was marked by a positive value in E
> = 2, current block of Z not diagonalized after 100\*N
> iterations (in inner while loop)  On exit D and E
> represent a matrix with the same singular values
> which the calling subroutine could use to finish the
> computation, or even feed back into SLASQ1
> = 3, termination criterion of outer while loop not met
> (program created more than N unreduced blocks)
