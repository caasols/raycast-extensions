SSYCON_3 estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a real symmetric matrix A using the factorization
computed by DSYTRF_RK or DSYTRF_BK:

A = P\*U\*D\*(U\*\*T)\*(P\*\*T) or A = P\*L\*D\*(L\*\*T)\*(P\*\*T),

where U (or L) is unit upper (or lower) triangular matrix,
U\*\*T (or L\*\*T) is the transpose of U (or L), P is a permutation
matrix, P\*\*T is the transpose of P, and D is symmetric and block
diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM \* norm(inv(A))).
This routine uses BLAS3 solver SSYTRS_3.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies whether the details of the factorization are
> stored as an upper or lower triangular matrix:
> = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = P\*U\*D\*(U\*\*T)\*(P\*\*T);
> = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = P\*L\*D\*(L\*\*T)\*(P\*\*T).

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A : REAL array, dimension (LDA,N) [in]
> Diagonal of the block diagonal matrix D and factors U or L
> as computed by SSYTRF_RK and SSYTRF_BK:
> a) ONLY diagonal elements of the symmetric block diagonal
> matrix D on the diagonal of A, i.e. D(k,k) = A(k,k);
> (superdiagonal (or subdiagonal) elements of D
> should be provided on entry in array E), and
> b) If UPLO = 'U': factor U in the superdiagonal part of A.
> If UPLO = 'L': factor L in the subdiagonal part of A.

LDA : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

E : REAL array, dimension (N) [in]
> On entry, contains the superdiagonal (or subdiagonal)
> elements of the symmetric block diagonal matrix D
> with 1-by-1 or 2-by-2 diagonal blocks, where
> If UPLO = 'U': E(i) = D(i-1,i),i=2:N, E(1) not referenced;
> If UPLO = 'L': E(i) = D(i+1,i),i=1:N-1, E(N) not referenced.
> 
> NOTE: For 1-by-1 diagonal block D(k), where
> 1 <= k <= N, the element E(k) is not referenced in both
> UPLO = 'U' or UPLO = 'L' cases.

IPIV : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [in]
> Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
> as determined by SSYTRF_RK or SSYTRF_BK.

ANORM : REAL [in]
> The 1-norm of the original matrix A.

RCOND : REAL [out]
> The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
> computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM \* AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
> estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

WORK : REAL array, dimension (2\*N) [out]

IWORK : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [out]

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
